= Problem: C$50 Finance (Part 2)

== Prerequisites

* PHP syntax
* PHP web programming
* C$50 Finance (Part 1)

== Objectives

* Introduce you to HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL.
* Teach you how to teach yourself new languages.

== Recommended Reading

* http://diveintohtml5.info/
* http://php.net/manual/en/langref.php

== Recommended Viewing

This problem is an extension of Part 1. As such, you should have already watched all the videos necessary to finishing C$50 Finance. If stuck, feel free to take a peek back at the videos, which can be found in the specification for Part 1!

include::../../../../fall/honesty.adoc[]

== Assessment

Your work on this problem set will be evaluated along four axes primarily.

Scope::
  To what extent does your code implement the features required by our specification?
Correctness::
  To what extent is your code consistent with our specifications and free of bugs?
Design::
  To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?
Style::
  To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?

All students, whether or not taking the course for a letter grade, must ordinarily submit this and all other problem sets to be eligible for a satisfactory grade unless granted an exception in writing by the course's heads.

== Set It Up

You have two options in setting up this problem:

. Use your own code from Part 1 and simply extend it, in which case you can skip down to the section entitled *Money Never Sleeps*
. Download the staff solution from Part 1 and extend that, the instructions for which are below

Log into https://cs50.io/[CS50 IDE] and, in a terminal window, execute

[source]
----
update50
sudo apt-get install -y php5-xdebug
----

to ensure that your workspace is up-to-date!

Like Part 1, this problem set comes with some distribution code that you'll need to download before getting started. Go ahead and execute

[source]
----
cd ~/workspace
----

in order to navigate to your `~/workspace` directory.  Then execute


[source,bash]
----
wget http://docs.cs50.net/2016/ap/problems/finance/2/finance2.zip
----

in order to download a ZIP (i.e., compressed version) of this problem set's distro as well as a MySQL database (that's been exported to a text file).  If you then execute

[source]
----
ls
----

you should see that you now have a file called `finance2.zip` in your `~/workspace` directory (along with `finance2.sql`).  Unzip it by executing the below.

[source]
----
unzip finance2.zip
----

If you again execute

[source]
----
ls
----

you should see that you now also have a directory called `8-3`.  You're now welcome to delete the ZIP file with the below.

[source]
----
rm -f 8-3.zip
----

If you next execute

[source]
----
cd 8-3
----

followed by

[source]
----
ls
----

you should see that `8-3` contains:

[source,bash]
----
config.json  includes/  public/  vendor/  views/
----

But more on those soon.

Next, ensure that `~/workspace/8-3/public` is "world-executable" by executing

[source]
----
chmod a+x ~/workspace/8-3/public
----

so that CS50 IDE's web server (Apache) and you (from a browser) will be able to access your work.  Then, navigate your way to `~/workspace/8-3/public` by executing the below.

[source]
----
cd ~/workspace/8-3/public
----

If you execute

[source]
----
ls
----

you should see that `public` contains four subdirectories and three files.  Ensure that the former are world-executable by executing the below.

[source]
----
chmod a+x css fonts img js
----

And ensure that the files within those directories are world-readable by executing the below.

[source]
----
chmod a+r css/* fonts/* img/* js/*
----

If unfamiliar, `\*` is a "wildcard character," so `css/*`, for instance, simply means "all files within the `css` directory."

For security's sake, don't make `~/workspace/8-3/includes` or `~/workspace/8-3/views` world-executable (or their contents world-readable), as they shouldn't be (potentially) accessible to the whole world (only to your PHP code, as you'll soon see).

Okay, let's now configure CS50 IDE's web server (aka Apache) to use `~/workspace/8-3/public` as its root. First ensure that Problem Set 6's `server` isn't still running (e.g., in another tab) by executing the below.

[source,bash]
----
killall -9 server
----

Next, ensure that Apache isn't already running (with some other root) by executing the below.

[source,bash]
----
apache50 stop
----

Then (re)start Apache with the below so that it uses `~/workspace/8-3/public` as its root.

[source,bash]
----
apache50 start ~/workspace/8-3/public
----

Next, start CS50 IDE's database server (MySQL) by executing the below.

[source,bash]
----
mysql50 start
----

Then open up `8-3/config.json`, which is a configuration file in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, which essentially means it's a collection of key-value pairs. JSON is a popular format for configuration files these days, since libraries that can read (i.e., parse) it exist for lots of languages, PHP among them. The curly braces at the top and bottom of this file indicate that the file contains an object, inside of which is one key (`database`) whose value is another object (per
the innermost curly braces). That latter object, meanwhile, has four keys (`host`, `name`, `password`, and `username`), each of whose values is a string, two of which are `TODO`! Those values will be used by CS50's PHP library (which can be found in `8-3/vendor`) in order to connect to your workspace's MySQL database. CS50's PHP library includes a function, `query`, that will allow you to send queries to that database.

Anyhow, let's tackle those ``TODO``s! Click the â“˜ icon toward CS50 IDE's top-right corner. You should see your *MySQL Username* and your *MySQL Password*. Copy and paste those values, one at a time, into the appropriate places in `config.json`, then save and close that file.

It's now time for a test! Visit `pass:[https://ide50-username.cs50.io/]`, where `username` is your own username.  You should find yourself redirected to C$50 Finance's login page!  (If you instead see *Forbidden*, odds are you missed a step earlier; best to try all those chmod steps again.)  If you try logging into C$50 Finance with a username of, oh, *skroob* and a password of *12345*, you should encounter an error about an *Unknown database*.  That's simply because you haven't created it yet!  Let's create it.

In a separate tab, head to `pass:[https://ide50-username.cs50.io/phpmyadmin]` (where `username` is, again, your own username) to access phpMyAdmin, a Web-based tool (that happens to be written in PHP) with which you can manage MySQL databases.  (MySQL is a free, open-source database that CS50, Facebook, and lots of other sites use.)  Log in with the same username and password that you pasted into `config.json`.  You should then find yourself at phpMyAdmin's main page.  

Within CS50 IDE, now, open up `8-3.sql`, which you downloaded earlier (via `wget`). You should see a whole bunch of SQL statements.  Highlight them all, select *Edit > Copy* (or hit control-c), then return to phpMyAdmin.  Click phpMyAdmin's *SQL* tab, and paste everything you copied into that page's big text box (which is below *Run SQL query/queries on server "127.0.0.1"*).  Skim what you just pasted to get a sense of the commands you're about to execute, then click *Go*.  You should then see a greenish banner indicating success (i.e., *1 row affected*).  In phpMyAdmin's top-left corner, you should now see link to a database called *8-3*, beneath which is a link to a table called *users*. (If you don't, try reloading the page.) But more on those later.

Return to `pass:[https://ide50-username.cs50.io/]` and reload that page.  Then try to log in again with a username of *skroob* and a password of *12345*.  0:-)

=== `chmod`

Just like Problem 8-3, you'll have to chmod any new PHP files you write. If you remember how, great! If you don't, just look back at the `chmod` section of the Problem 8-3 spec!

== Money Never Sleeps

In Part 1, you implemented the functionality to register new users, get stock quotes, and show a user's stock portfolio. Now, its time to let them "buy" and "sell" stocks, filling up (or emptying) their portfolio!

=== sell

And now it is time to implement the ability to sell with a controller called, say, `sell.php` and some number of views.  We leave the design of this feature to you.  But know that you can delete rows from your table (on behalf of, say, President Skroob) with SQL like the below.

[source,sql]
----
DELETE FROM portfolios WHERE user_id = 9 AND symbol = 'FREE'
----

We leave it to you to infer exactly what that statement should do.  Of course, you could try the above out via phpMyAdmin's *SQL* tab.  Now what about the user's cash balance?  Odds are, your user is going to want the proceeds of all sales.  So selling a stock involves updating not only your table for users' portfolios but `users` as well.  We leave it to you to determine how to compute how much cash a user is owed upon sale of some stock.  But once you know that amount (say, $500), SQL like the below should take care of the deposit (for, say, President Skroob). 

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE users SET cash = cash + 500 WHERE id = 9
----

Of course, if the database or web server happens to die between this `DELETE` and `UPDATE`, President Skroob might lose out on all of that cash.  You need not worry about such cases!  It's also possible, because of multithreading and, thus, race conditions, that a clever president could trick your site into paying out more than once.  You need not worry about such cases either!  Though, if you're so very inclined, you can employ SQL "transactions" (with InnoDB tables).  See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/sql-syntax-transactions.html if curious.

It's fine, for simplicity, to require that users sell all shares of some stock or none, rather than only a few.  Needless to say, try out your code by logging in as some user and selling some stuff.  You can always "buy" it back manually with phpMyAdmin.

As always, be sure that your HTML is valid!

And as always, here is Zamyla!

=== buy

Now it's time to support actual buys.  Implement the ability to buy, with a controller called, say, `buy.php` and some number of views.  (As before, you need not worry about interruptions of service or race conditions.)  The interface with which you provide a user is entirely up to you, though, as before, feel free to look to https://finance.cs50.net/ for inspiration or hints.  Of course, you'll need to ensure that a user cannot spend more cash than he or she has on hand.  And you'll want to make sure that users can only buy whole shares of stocks, not fractions thereof.  For this latter requirement, know that a call like

[source,php]
----
preg_match("/^\d+$/", $_POST["shares"])
----

will return `true` if and only if `$_POST["shares"]` contains a non-negative integer, thanks to its use of a regular expression.  See http://www.php.net/preg_match for details.  Take care to apologize to the user if you must reject their input for any reason.  In other words, be sure to perform rigorous error-checking.  (We leave to you to determine what needs to be checked!)

When it comes time to store stocks' symbols in your database table, take care to store them in uppercase (as is convention), no matter how they were inputted by users, so that you don't accidentally treat, say, `free` and `FREE` as different stocks.  Don't force users, though, to input symbols in uppercase.

Incidentally, if you implemented your table for users' portfolios as we did ours (with that joint key), know that SQL like the below (which, unfortunately, wraps onto two lines) will insert a new row into table unless the specified pair of `id` and `symbol` already exists in some row, in which case that row's number of shares will simply be increased (say, by `10`).

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO portfolios (user_id, symbol, shares) VALUES(9, 'FREE', 10) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE shares = shares + VALUES(shares)
----

As always, be sure to bang on your code.  And be sure that your HTML is valid!

Here's Zamyla with some additional help:

=== history

Alright, so your users can now buy and sell stocks and even check their portfolio's value.  But they have no way of viewing their history of transactions.

Enhance your implementations for buying and selling in such a way that you start logging transactions, recording for each:

* Whether a stock was bought or sold.
* The symbol bought or sold.
* The number of shares bought or sold.
* The price of a share at the time of transaction.
* The date and time of the transaction.

Then, by way of a controller called, say, `history.php` and some number of views, enable users to peruse their own history of transactions, formatted as you see fit.  Be sure that your HTML is valid! Feel free to learn from the staff's implementation of C$50 Finance at https://finance.cs50.net/.

== Check It Out

Before you consider this problem set done, best to ask yourself these questions and then go back and improve your code as needed!  Do not consider the below an exhaustive list of expectations, though, just some helpful reminders.  The checkboxes that have come before these represent the exhaustive list!  To be clear, consider the questions below rhetorical.  No need to answer them in writing for us, since all of your answers should be "yes!"

* Is the HTML generated by all of your PHP files valid according to link:http://validator.w3.org/[]?
* Do your pages detect and handle invalid inputs properly?
* Are you recording users' histories of transactions properly?
* Did you choose appropriate data types for your database tables' fields?
* Are you displaying any dollar amounts to at least two decimal places but no more than four?
* Are you storing stocks' symbols in your table(s) in uppercase?

== Turn It In


. When ready to submit, "export" your MySQL database (i.e., save it into a text file) by executing the commands below, where `username` is your own username, pasting your MySQL password when prompted for a password.  (Recall that you can see your MySQL password by clicking the â“˜ icon toward CS50 IDE's top-right corner.) For security, you won't see the password as you paste it.
+
[source]
----
cd ~/workspace/8-3
mysqldump -u username -p finance > finance.sql
----
+
If you type `ls` thereafter, you should see that you have a new file called `finance.sql` in `~/workspace/finance`.  (If you realize later that you need to make a change to your database and re-export it, you can delete `finance.sql` with `rm finance.sql`, then re-export as before.)
. Toward CS50 IDE's top-left corner, within its "file browser" (not within a terminal window), control-click or right-click your `finance` folder and then select *Download*. You should find that your browser has downloaded `finance.tar.gz`, a "gzipped tarball" that's similar in spirit to a ZIP file.
. Await instructions from your instructor on how to submit the tarball!


This was Problem C$50 Finance (Part 2).
