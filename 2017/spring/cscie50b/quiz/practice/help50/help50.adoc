== Human `help50`

=== Problem

If not yet familiar, `help50` is a command line tool included with CS50 IDE that makes an effort to translate some of the more arcane error messages that other tools, such as `clang` or `valgrind`, sometimes spit out. In this way, it serves as a "virtual TF" of sorts, hopefully helping nudge students in the right direction, so that they needn't wait for a staff member at office hours when a little bit of translation of the error message is really all that's needed to move on.

If you aren't familiar with `help50` just yet, now is the time! Here's an example of a simple broken C file, `rocket.c`, which is supposed to count down from `10` and then print `blastoff!`:

[source,c]
----
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int i;
    for(i = 10; i > 0; i--);
    {
        printf("%i... ", i);
    }
    printf("blastoff!\n");
}
----

Copy this code *exactly* into your IDE (even if you've already spotted the problem) and try to compile this program with `make rocket`. You should receive the following output from `clang`:

[source]
----
rocket.c:6:28: error: for loop has empty body [-Werror,-Wempty-body]
    for(int i = 10; i > 0; i--);
----

Hmm... that `for` loop's body looks awfully populated to me; maybe `help50` can make some sense of it? Let's attempt to recompile `rocket`, but this time prepend the command with `help50`. Perhaps this error message sheds more light onto the problem:

[source]

Helping with...

rocket.c:6:28: error: for loop has empty body [-Werror,-Wempty-body]

Try removing the semicolon directly after the closing parentheses of the for loop on line 6 of rocket.c.
----

Ahh, that helps! If you remove the semicolon and attempt to recompile, everything works as expected.

`help50` works because the staff has written a series of "matchers" for different errors into its source code. Basically, we've written code that looks for certain types of error messages that `clang` or `valgrind` might output, and when one of those matchers, well, _matches_ what we're looking for, it outputs a more human-friendly translation of that message. Unfortunately, it seems the number of errors these programs can spit out is quite large, and `help50` doesn't yet have so-called "matchers" for all types of errors. In those cases, it'll just tell you that it doesn't know what to say.

Put yourself in the shoes of a TF or CA at office hours. If you see errors like the five below (which you or your classmates have actually experienced this semester!), how would you advise `help50` to respond? A friendly one- or two-sentence note for each should suffice!
