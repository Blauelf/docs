mario.c:19:27: error: invalid conversion specifier '
----
+
It looks like you're trying to use '%pass:[#]' as a format specifier in `printf`, but `printf` doesn't support that specifier like it does with `%s` or `%i`. If you want to print `pass:[#]`, try just printing it directly!

initials.c:13:10: error: definition of variable with array type needs an explicit size or an initializer
----
+
It looks like you've declared an array on line 13 of initials.c without giving it a size. When you declare an array, you either need to provide its size explicitly, or initialize its contents at the same time as when you declare it.

find.c:53:16: error: non-object type 'bool (int, int *, int)' is not assignable
----
+
It looks like you're trying to assign a boolean value (`true` or `false`) to a variable that is not of type `bool`!

recover.c:22:10: error: variable 'blockptr' is used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is false [-Werror,-Wsometimes-uninitialized]
----
+
It looks like in your program you seem to be declaring `blockptr`, and only assigning it a value if the condition on line 22 of recover.c is true. Make sure that a value is assigned to `blockptr` regardless, before it could possibly be used later on.

Helping with...

dictionary.c:146:36: error: passing 'const char *' to parameter of type
      'char *' discards qualifiers
----
+
It looks like you're trying to pass a variable of type `const char *` as a parameter to a function that only accepts `char *`. That would permit a variable with the `const` qualifier to be modified, which isn't allowed!
