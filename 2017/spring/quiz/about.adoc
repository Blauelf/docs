= About Quiz

Released at noon on Tue 4/18 and due by noon on Thu 4/20 is a take-home quiz that will cover Weeks 0 through 10 (and Problem Sets 0 through 8), with emphasis on Week 6 (and Problem Set 6) onward. The quiz is open-book: you may use any and all non-human resources during the quiz, but the only humans to whom you may turn for help or from whom you may receive help are the courseâ€™s heads.

The quiz will be released via the course's website and will be submitted via `submit50`. You should expect to spend several (but not 48!) hours on the quiz.

Sections on Sun 4/9, Mon 4/10, Tue 4/11, and Wed 4/12 will also be opportunities for review. Office hours on Sat 4/8, Sun 4/9, Tue 4/11, Wed 4/12, Sat 4/15, and Sun 4/16 will be additional opportunities for Q&A. There will be no office hours on Tue 4/19 or Wed 4/20, nor will CS50 Discuss be staffed during the quiz.

The teaching fellows held a course-wide review session in the fall, which is available on the course website to supplement sections this week.

The quiz's format will be similar to the test's format, with short-answer questions as well as longer-answer questions. Some questions may involve code (for which you're welcome to use CS50 IDE).
