Toward the beginning of World 1-1 in Nintendo's Super Mario Brothers, Mario must hop over two "half-pyramids" of blocks as he heads toward a flag pole.  Below is a screenshot.

Write, in a file called `mario.c` in your `~/workspace/pset1` directory, a program that recreates these half-pyramids using hashes (`#`) for blocks.  However, to make things more interesting, first prompt the user for the half-pyramids' heights, a non-negative integer no greater than `23`. (The height of the half-pyramids pictured above happens to be `4`, the width of each half-pyramid `4`, with an a gap of size `2` separating them.) Then, generate (with the help of `printf` and one or more loops) the desired half-pyramids. Take care to left-align the bottom-left corner of the left-hand half-pyramid, as in the sample output below, wherein boldfaced text represents some user's input.

~/workspace/pset1/ $ [underline]#./mario#
Height: [underline]#4#
   pass:[#  #]
  pass:[##  ##]
 pass:[###  ###]
pass:[####  ####]

No need to generate the bricks, cloud, numbers, or text in the sky or Mario himself. Just the half-pyramids!

We leave it to you to determine how to compile this program.

Like to implement these two half-pyramids but not sure how to approach them? Here's Zamyla with a walkthrough.
